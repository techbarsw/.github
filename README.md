# TechBar

**TechBar** is an engineering partner for CTOs and senior engineering leaders who need to modernize complex systems, scale data-heavy platforms, and ship AI-driven capabilities without compromising stability.

We specialize in **hard technical problems** - legacy systems, advanced data pipelines, and AI applied where it actually delivers value.

## What We Do

### Legacy & Complex Systems
- Support and modernization of large, undocumented legacy codebases
- Gradual refactoring - zero big-bang rewrites
- High-risk systems: compliance-heavy, business-critical, low-tolerance-for-failure
- Embedded systems and low-level integrations when abstraction is not an option

### Data Engineering
- Design and implementation of robust data pipelines
- Data platforms ready for analytics, ML, and GenAI workloads
- Data quality, observability, and performance at scale

### Machine Learning & AI
- Classical ML: forecasting, recommendations, anomaly detection, optimization
- Generative AI: LLM-powered assistants, internal tools, automation
- Embeddings: semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), personalization
- Pragmatic AI - production-ready, measurable, maintainable

### Cloud & Platform Engineering
- Cloud-native and hybrid architectures
- DevOps, CI/CD, infrastructure as code
- Performance optimization and cost control
- Reliability, security, and scalability by design

## How We Work

- Engineering-led teams - senior engineers, not body-leasing
- Strong focus on system design and long-term maintainability
- Predictable delivery for complex, high-uncertainty projects
- Tight collaboration with in-house engineering and product teams

We integrate deeply, take ownership, and treat core systems as critical assets.
